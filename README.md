# Massage App Frontend
This repository is for the frontend styling and user experience for a simple massage booking application. This is the first solo project that I built during the third module of Flatiron School's immersive software development program. This project was built in one week. The backend is a Ruby on Rails API. You can find that repo here. https://github.com/christy-inman/massage-app-backend
